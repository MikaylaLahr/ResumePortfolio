                        <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                        <p>For my team's final project in Future Energy System, we evaluated whether off-shore wind turbines 
                            are the most viable renewable energy source for the tri-state are (New York, Connecticut and New 
                            Jersey). The coastline data maintained by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management of 
                            the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows New York with 2625 miles, New 
                            Jersey with 1792 miles, and Connecticut with 618 miles of shoreline. Considering the extensive 
                            coastline in the tri-state area, offshore wind turbines could potentially provide the area with 
                            clean and reliable electricity. This research explored the techniques for using publicly available 
                            resources to calculate offshore wind power capabilities. Using wind speed data from meteorological 
                            buoys, the annual energy output of four representative offshore wind turbines were calculated, and 
                            the maximum number of turbines was based on the area available determined by the wind regime, wake 
                            effects, and turbine footprint. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Toward this end, the group conducted research on the following questions: What percentage of the 
                            electricity consumed by the tri-state area could offshore wind turbines provide? More specifically, 
                            can offshore wind turbines provide all the electricity needed for residential use and how does that 
                            compare with the electricity demand of commercial use? Is offshore wind the most feasible renewable 
                            energy source for that area, or would land wind farms, solar farms or a combination provide a better 
                            alternative? 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Off-Shore Wind Turbine Modeling, Buoy Datasets, and Analysis</h2>
                        <p>To address these questions, the team used buoy datasets SDHN4, 44065, 44039, and 44009 to determine 
                            the amount of energy that can be provided by wind turbines in each of those areas. Turbine modeling 
                            was based on cut-in and cut-out  wind speeds of 4 m/s and 25-m/s wind speeds respectively, which are 
                            typical for most modern turbines. An energy analysis was performed using turbine models with rotor 
                            diameter of 164 m, swept area of 21124 m2, and hub-heights of 100 m achieving nominal rated power of 
                            8-MW at 13 m/s.  I worked with another team member, to utilize the programming platform MATLAB for 
                            determining the Average Hourly Wind Speed, Hub Height Wind Speed, Power Output per Hour, Monthly 
                            Output, using the datasets from each of the four buoys. The Power Output per Hour and Monthly Output 
                            of the turbine models along with the maximum number possible at each buoy location were compared to 
                            actual monthly demand. The team used public documents from the U.S. Department of Energy, spanning 
                            January 2001 through January 2021, to determine total monthly electricity consumption for each state, 
                            categorized according to residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, and other uses.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The capacity factor values for the wind turbine near each of four buoys locations were found to be less 
                            than other types of energy technologies such as natural gas, coal and nuclear. However, the environmental 
                            benefits of wind resources as input energy for offshore wind turbines is an important consideration. In 
                            the end, offshore wind farms were not able to provide enough power to New York and New Jersey to be 
                            considered as a primary source of energy. Nevertheless, since Connecticut uses less electricity than 
                            New York and New Jersey, an offshore wind farm could have a big impact on the residential sector. In 
                            order to counteract the lower wind speeds during the warmer months, it is best to combine multiple 
                            sources of renewable energy. Solar energy is the most likely and efficient renewable energy source for 
                            this application.

                        <p>For this project, I collaborated with five students to design and manufacture a piston water pump 
                            with given constraints and parameters provided by the instructor. Size, efficiency, and cost were 
                            three of the main constraints. One of my responsibilities was the Fusion 360 CAD modeling of the 
                            pump. To reach the minimum output rate of 1 liter/min to an elevation of 1.5m above the drive 
                            shaft axis, the team manipulated the size, number, and the configuration of the pumps. Two of 
                            the preliminary designs were based on the scotch-yoke mechanism, while the third used a 
                            slider-crank mechanism. Of these two types of piston pumps, the team chose the scotch-yoke. 
                            This choice was preferred because it was simpler to machine, since the slider crank mechanism 
                            needed two rods to transition from rotational to linear movement, whereas the scotch-yoke mechanism 
                            only needed one rod. To maximize the efficiency of the pump, but minimize the instability, cost, and 
                            production time of the design at the same time it was decided to have two pistons connected to our 
                            yoke. The two pumps also allowed for a continuous flow of transported water. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Final Design</h2>
                        <p>After review of the pump design, it was determined that the piston holder, a wide plate that connects 
                            the two pistons, was too large. Because of the piston holder size, it would be difficult to machine 
                            with holes on the side. Therefore, the piston holder was redesigned so that it is directly connected 
                            to the inner two piston caps rather than the outer two caps. In addition, the original yoke size was 
                            too small making it difficult to machine so its size was increased. Bottom supports on each of the 
                            piston caps were added to the piston to reduce the weight on the piston holder. Ensuring the chosen 
                            strict tolerances were maintained was challenging and unrealistic. Because the tolerance were very 
                            small, machined parts were being redone when they would have worked.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Results - Analysis and Design Improvement</h2>
                        <p>The final machined piston pump moved 4.0 L/min of water which was four times the minimum requirement, 
                            however, water leakage resulted in less than the theoretically performance value of  24.12 L/min. 
                            The success of the pump is attributed to its design that included two cylinders allowing for constant 
                            flow, a scotch yoke being used rather than a Slider-Crank as well as precision machining and assembly. 
                            If the  pump was attached vertically instead of horizontally it may have performed better. In addition, 
                            while the cylinders were not sealed, they had a good vacuum seal and did not leak significantly.

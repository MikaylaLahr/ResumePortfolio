                        <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                        <p>Since 2019, I had been a member of Cornell Mars Rover Project Team which is made up of 70 members 
                            from a variety of majors at the university. Cornell Mars Rover (CMR) is a student-run engineering 
                            project team with the goal of competing at the Annual University Rover Challenge at the Mars Desert 
                            Research Center in Utah. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I was the Cornell Mars Rover Drives Lead whose eight member group was responsible for the design, 
                            analysis, and in-house manufacturing of the roverâ€™s chassis, suspension, electric housing, wheels, 
                            and camera mast. As Drives Team, I worked with other team leads, to define broad-reaching goals and 
                            target completion dates. My responsibilities included leading weekly meetings with team Drive team 
                            members for project updates and assignments. I also represent the Drive's team at weekly 
                            cross-functional presentations and discussions with the eight other CMR team leads. In addition, 
                            I compiled and wrote technical documents on the suspension, wheel design progress, and design 
                            specifications. Along with my drives team, we designed and performed in-house construction of a 
                            rocker-bogie suspension with custom flexible 3D printed drive wheels. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Drives Subsystems</h2>
                            <h3 class="subheading">Frame and ECore</h3>
                            <p>The frame of the rover was responsible for providing structure to act as the central body of the 
                                rover. Many other subsystems, both within and outside of Drives, need to integrate with the frame. 
                                This requireed the collaboration of several different members across different subteams. The Fall 
                                2022 frame design consists of a combination between a planar frame and a box frame. This design 
                                sought to reduce weight while, using the planar frame, while also maximizing the mounting space 
                                for the camera mast and Astrotech systems in the back of the rover on the box frame. The frame was 
                                made from aluminum 6061 and carbon fiber connection bars. The majority of the bars used in the design 
                                were aluminum 6061. The carbon fiber bars were located at the front of the frame, connected to the 
                                arm mount to provide the structural integrity needed for the weight of the arm. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The ECore was responsible for housing all of the needed electrical equipment and boards for the rover. 
                                Requirements included that ECore needed to have sufficient air cooling in order for the electrical 
                                boards to not overheat. The top cover of the ECore also needed to be secure when closed, but also 
                                provide accessibility when placing or altering electrical boards. The main design constraints 
                                surrounding the Ecore included the shape and dimensions of the frame and the size, number, and 
                                placement of the electrical boards.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading">Suspension</h3>
                            <p>The suspension of the rover supported the rover by connecting the wheels to the frame. The goal of 
                                the suspension system was to mitigate the forces and impulses transmitted to the frame, provide a 
                                smooth method of traversal over rough terrain, and mitigate the chances of flipping. These goals 
                                were accomplished through the use of a rocker-bogie suspension system. The rocker-bogie suspension 
                                system pivots around two joints. The rocker joint is connected to the frame as well as the rod going 
                                to the differential bar. When the rocker mount rotates the rod is either pushed forward or backwards, 
                                resulting the opposite motion on the other side of the suspension. The bogie joint connects the front 
                                rocker arm to the bogie that rotates around the connection point. The rocker-bogie suspension allows 
                                for all six wheels to remain in contact with the ground throughout traversal. This feature helps with 
                                the stability of the rover and prevents tipping.
                            </p>
                            <p>The suspension design for Fall 2022 was made from aluminum 6061 connection bars to reduce the cost of 
                                the rover. The connection mounts for the rocker and bogie joints will be CNC'd from aluminum 6061 to 
                                maintain structural integrity. The other connectors will be printed from carbon fiber filament on the 
                                Onyx printers at the RPL. The wheel mounts will be CNC'd from aluminum 6061. The same differential bar 
                                that is on the Spring 2021 rover will be used in this design.  
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading">Wheels</h3>
                            <p>The wheels of the Cornell Mars rover interfaced with the rocker-bogie suspension system. They were 
                                connected to the suspension through the wheel mount interface. The six wheels on the rover were needed        
                                for several different reasons: 
                                <li>Provide an interface between the terrain and the rover.</li>
                                <li>Attach to the wheel mounts and rotate by way of the electrical system.</li>
                                <li>Mitigate the forces on the suspension and thus the frame of the rover.</li>  
                            </p>
                            <p>The wheels were powered by Maxon motors, with the goal of using the cycloidal drive gearboxes. The 
                                design of the wheels consist of an outer tire that is printed from ABS*. A truss design was used in 
                                the wheels to aid in the distribution of forces. The tread design prevented the wheels from slipping 
                                on the ground and allowed the rover to gain traction. The wheel hub was CNC'd from aluminum 6061 in 
                                two parts. The front and back plate were connected by spokes through the wheel. To maintain a constant 
                                stiffness surrounding the spokes a stiffness band will be included inside of the wheel. 
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="subheading">Camera Mast</h3>
                            <p>The camera mast of the rover was also designed The camera mast included a carbon fiber mast with several 
                                3D printed mounts made from PLA attached. These mounts included: lidar, pan tilt camera, ZED cam, GPS, 
                                antenna, antenna white box, and the connection mounts to the frame. The lidar mount was attached under 
                                the arm mount. The camera mast was attached to the back of the box frame. The goal of the camera mast 
                                was to hold all of the rover's needed equipment for CS and other subteams to successfully create 
                                redesigns to traverse the URC course. 
                            </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Over the course of the semester, I set several personal goals for myself to accomplish as well as teamwide 
                            goals for the Drives sub team. These goals included becoming a more effective leader, improve my working 
                            knowledge of all sub teams on CMR, and improving my communication skills. Throughout the semester I focused 
                            on opportunities to improve my skills and help CMR become a more efficient team. 
                        </p>
                        <p>One of my proudest accomplishment this semester is taking on the challenge of redesigning all of the systems 
                            on Drives. This was an enormous effort to rethink how to improve the past years design, while not having any 
                            significant testing data to work with in the analysis. Working through these design iterations took 
                            significant time and effort and I am very proud of the improvements made. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I learned several unexpected things about leadership. One of the main things that I learned was about directing 
                            the timeline of a project and understanding how to achieve the project goals with the resources available. 
                            It is important to understand the working knowledge of the team in order to better guide and be informed 
                            about what challenges might be faced when designing and testing each system.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some challenges faced over the course of the semester included the integration of each subsystem of Drives 
                            as well as the integration of other subsystems onto the frame of the rover. In order to address this 
                            challenge clear communication was necessary between everyone on the team to reach a consensus on the 
                            integration design between systems. These issues were addressed, and I assembled the full CAD of the 
                            Drives system assembly. A system assembly of the entire rover was also constructed. Potential problems 
                            in the future can involve issues in the manufacturing process. In order to mitigate these issues a 
                            manufacturing plan will be made.
                        </p>
                        <p>During the semester the time I spent doing work for CMR ranged from 14 hours to 25 hours a week. The time 
                            spent dedicated to CMR was a lot more than some of my other classes and was difficult at times to manage. 
                            Overall, I planned my time well with other courses and completed all of my assignments. I was able to apply 
                            knowledge from my courses in product design as well as statics. I also have an interest in Systems 
                            Engineering and enjoyed the opportunity to take on a leadership role where I could examine how a full system 
                            of many smaller systems is assembled. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In the future I plan on using my knowledge and skillset to better improve my leadership abilities. I will 
                            continue to set multiple deadlines and goals to guide the projects for the eight members of the Drive 
                            team. I learned a lot about how to inform and instruct team members that needed guidance as well as 
                            plan for the integration of smaller sub systems into the larger design of the rover.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
                        <p>For this project I worked with another student to create a prosthetic foot suitable for wearing with 
                            high heel shoes. The majority of currently available prosthetics do not have adjustable ankle support 
                            to accommodate the angle of a higher heel. Custom-made prosthetics for high heel shoes are expensive 
                            and not covered by insurance.  Our solution allows the prosthetic to be worn with both flat and high 
                            heel shoes. It addresses the issue of the toes and forefoot maintaining contact with the bottom of the 
                            shoe, while also having a rotating ankle. The foot is divided into two parts separating the toes and 
                            the upper foot. The upper part has a carbon fiber rod embedded in the structure of the foot that slightly 
                            extends into the forefoot area. The rod is connected to the rotating lever ankle hinge. The prosthetic 
                            can achieve a heel height up to 4.5 inches. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The foot is manufactured by printing a lattice structure from polyurethane. Each part of the foot is made 
                            separately and has a different stiffness. The upper part of the foot is the most stiff region as it does 
                            not need to bend as much as the forefoot. The front of the foot is more flexible and allows the toes to bend.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Main Features</h2>
                        <li>Breaks up foot into 3 parts (at places where it bends in a high heel shoe)</li>
                        <li>Rigid rod in top part connected to a rotating ankle hinge</li>
                        <li>3D printed lattice structure made of polyurethane with increasing density from heel to toe of foot</li>
                        <li>Can be used both with flat shoes and high heels, eliminating the need to buy two different prosthetics</li>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Features Beyond The Project Goal</h2>
                        <p>All features of the design are important for the full functionality of the product. The foot will be 
                            available in different stiffnesses for different weight ranges. Toe bending into the shoe allows for 
                            there to be a better fit and no gaps between the bottom of the shoe and the foot. The outer shell (outside 
                            of the lattice structure) will be a foot shell that is available in a variety of different shades to match 
                            different skin tones.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Service Environment Conditions</h2>
                        <p>The product is designed to work for both flat and high heel shoes. Since it goes everywhere as the foot of 
                            a consumer, it must be able to function in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as at various 
                            temperatures and weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.). It also must be rigid and stable enough to support 
                            a userâ€™s weight while also allowing enough flexibility to bend into the shape of the shoe. The foot must 
                            also be comfortable to walk on.The proposed solution is to design a prosthetic foot that can work in both 
                            a flat shoe as well as a shoe with a heel up to 4.5 inches. The design will have three main components, 
                            a printed polyurethane lattice foot shell, a carbon fiber rod through the center of the foot, and a rotating 
                            lever hinge ankle. Both sections of the foot shell are a lattice structure. The foot shell was printed using 
                            EPU40 on the Carbon printer. The toes and ball of the foot shell have a lower stiffness than the heel and 
                            middle of the foot. This feature allows the forefoot to bend and adjust into the shape of the front section 
                            of a shoe, while allowing the upper half of the foot to retain more of its structure. This feature will 
                            accommodate flat shoes and high heel shoes as the lattice structure and material properties of the 
                            polyurethane allow for bending. To adjust for weight ranges and activity levels the lattice can be altered. 
                            The carbon fiber rod is incorporated into the design to provide rigid support to the foot. The rod ends just 
                            before the beginning of the toes. The outer foot shell surrounds the carbon fiber rod allowing the heel of 
                            the foot to absorb some of the forces experienced when walking. Attached to the carbon fiber rod is the 
                            ankle. The ankle rotates using a lever hinge and can be adjusted to different positions depending on the 
                            heel height. The ankle mount is made from aluminum.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Finite Element Analysis - Static</h2>
                        <p>A 800 N force upwards was applied at the area where the bar ends, just before the toes start (tip of the bar) 
                            to represent the reaction force from the ground when the user is wearing a high heel shoe, and their weight 
                            is concentrated near the toes. The ankle hinge components were assigned aluminum material properties and 
                            the bar was assigned carbon fiber material properties. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on the 
                            bar to determine if the bar alone could withstand the forces that the prosthetic foot would experience. 
                            The static structural FEA results are shown below. Solutions were found for von-mises stress, total 
                            deformation, and safety factor.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Individual Additional Prosthetic Foot Design</h2>
                        <p>Throughout the duration of modeling, printing, and analyzing the previous design I thought about some 
                            potential issues that may occur once the prosthetic was manufactured and used for an extended period 
                            of time. The potential issues are listed below:
                            <li>One potential issue is the toes and forefoot. In the previous design the adjustment in the forefoot 
                                area is dependent solely on the material properties and flexibility of the polyurethane lattice 
                                structure. The range of angles and movement that the toes need to accommodate in order to bend 
                                from a flat shoe to a 4.5 inch heel is large. A concern with the design is that when walking in 
                                the flat foot position, there is nothing restricting the toes from continuously bending upwards. 
                                This could result in a loss of support and stability when walking in flat shoes. The user might 
                                feel as though they are slipping as the toes bend every step. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Another potential issue is the durability of the polyurethane lattice structure. The printed foot 
                                has very thin connections between each connection point in the lattice. The previous design may work 
                                for a short time, but I am concerned about the longevity of the product. Walking on the prosthetic 
                                every day may wear down the polyurethane faster than other prosthetic feet on the market that are 
                                made from stiffer materials. 
                            </li>
                            <li>In addition, cleaning the foot would be difficult due to the lattice structure. A prosthetic foot 
                                that can be worn in various weather conditions and climates (rain, snow, dirt, mud) is optimal for 
                                a manufactured design. If dirt, debris, or small rocks enter into the lattice structure it may be 
                                difficult to remove those particles from the foot and take a long time to clean. There is also the 
                                possibility that the user may not notice that rocks have entered into the lattice. Not removing these 
                                rocks and dirt will affect the performance of the prosthetic. 
                            </li>

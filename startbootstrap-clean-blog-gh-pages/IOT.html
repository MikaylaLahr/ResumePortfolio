                        <h2 class="subheading">Internet of Things (IoT) Vineyard Project</h2>
                        <p>My project team worked to bring community level engagement of the Internet of Things (IoT) 
                            to agriculture. Specifically, we worked with Sheldrake Point and Knapp Wineries, both located on 
                            Cayuga Lake in the New York State Finger Lakes region, to develop IoT systems that can best suit 
                            their needs. The team focused on the application of IoT using sensors to monitor elements essential 
                            for grape cultivation. Through communication with the wineries the list of parameters was narrowed 
                            down to temperature, leaf wetness, and soil moisture to effectively monitor the chances of frost 
                            occurring as well as disease. Both wineries were also interested in monitoring the temperature of 
                            the winery tanks, which was something that the team did not previously consider. I learned that 
                            most wineries have built in temperature monitoring for their tanks, so we only needed to integrate 
                            an IoT system with their existing system to send alerts should the temperature exit an acceptable 
                            range (as this could ruin a batch). According to the winemaker, this is a frequent issue even with 
                            modern temperature regulation systems so having an IoT alert system would be invaluable. The team 
                            explored different types of sensors that would best serve their needs and discussed a few sensor 
                            options with the winery to get their opinion on what would work best. For the winery, next steps 
                            include determining how to best integrate IoT with the existing temperature monitors and deciding 
                            how often temperature needs to be measured.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Community Engagement</h2>
                        <p>The engineering designs were shaped by community engagement. A design project can only be successful 
                            with guidance and advice from community partners. The IoT system needed to provide a benefit to the 
                            community partners. Communication with the wineries helped determine the best way to plan out an IoT 
                            system that would be a reasonably priced and still help the monitor conditions in the vineyard and 
                            winery. Cost was a concern for the wineries which was an important factor in the IoT design project.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Knowledge Gained</h2>
                        <p>Having the opportunity to work with community partners, Knapp Winery and Sheldrake Point Winery, was 
                            very rewarding and communication with them was crucial to the success of the project. I learned a 
                            great deal on how to conduct an interview and ask unbiased questions. Team members and I learned about 
                            their experiences and perspectives through email as well as scheduling meetings on Zoom. When working 
                            with community engagement it is important to remember the three components: relationship, process, and 
                            results. Before starting this project, I thought that the relationship with the community partners was 
                            important, but I never had experience establishing a relationship with any community partners for an 
                            IoT or engineering project. This new experience allowed me to better understand how to effectively 
                            communicate with the community partners. I understood that the wineriesâ€™ time is valuable, and this 
                            prompted me to become better at organizing my ideas before sending emails or attending meetings. 
                            Planning out the questions I was going to ask or share the ideas and research that was done with the 
                            wineries was very helpful in having an efficient and effective meeting. The process of working on the 
                            project was also very important to the success of the final design. Before taking this class, I have 
                            worked as a part of several design teams at Cornell such as Cornell Mars Rover and I have also worked 
                            in groups for class projects. Classes at Cornell have taught me how to work in teams as well as ensure 
                            that I can work individually on some assignments as well. After taking this class, I understood that 
                            the process of drafting and finalizing a design is incredibly important. Communication between team 
                            members is essential to improve the quality of the work done.

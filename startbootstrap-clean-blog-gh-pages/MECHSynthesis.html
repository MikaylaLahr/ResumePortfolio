                        <p>The Divider Slider was created for a Mechanical Synthesis project to design something that would be 
                            useful to essential COVID workers. I was responsible for modeling the final project in Fusion 360 
                            which involved the curves of the divider fabric and frame. I was pleased how the CAD model 
                            represents a real-life product. A challenging part of the project was creating a design that would 
                            reduce the space in between each divider. After receiving feedback from the OPD Preliminary Design 
                            Review on reducing the space in between each divider, I thought through several ways to solve this 
                            issue. I decided that creating a clip-in panel, as shown in the CAD Model, would be the most effective 
                            option for the user while also preserving the functionality of the design.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">User Needs</h2>
                        <p>The project involved a user needs interview of essential workers from the Albany University COVID 
                            Vaccination Site. Before the interview, my partner and myself came up with a procedure to mitigate 
                            the effect of confirmation and social desirability bias was followed. As a team we agreed that all 
                            information would be recorded and evaluated, none would be ignored. Interview strategies and question 
                            sets were used to encourage greater insight through personal stories and obtain relevant unbiased 
                            information. The interview plan contained questions as well as a script which included topics such as 
                            “Please take us through a typical day at your work as an essential worker” and based on their response 
                            ask them about pain points; ask about safety and the work environment; follow up with more specific 
                            questions based on their responses. An issue that the essential workers brought up was how loud the 
                            vaccine area can be with dozens of people surrounding the booths and tents where background noise can 
                            be heard through canvas walls making it difficult for assistants, nurses, and hard-of-hearing patients 
                            to communicate. We concluded that the need to constantly speak louder than the sound level of normal 
                            conversation caused quite a lot of strain during a work shift and was an important concern of essential 
                            workers. Therefore, reducing the noise level at the vaccine center through a station design modification 
                            would help communication and the work environment, was an important issue to address.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Design Process</h2>
                        <p>Another interesting and valuable part of the project was completing the Crazy-8s idea generation exercise 
                            and designing Storyboards. The Crazy-8s exercise allowed me to brainstorm ideas that I may not have thought 
                            of, examine each idea, and identify which ideas were feasible and beneficial. The Storyboard exercise for 
                            a chosen design concept was beneficial because it allowed us to narrow our focus towards a particular 
                            product, while remaining creative in the design process. The Storyboard helped to visualize the essential 
                            worker’s experience and lead to finding the best design concept.
                        </p>
                        <p>The engineering design process for creating a unique design for a divider was a very challenging part of 
                            the project. My partner and I went through several different design ideas for what would be the most 
                            effective way to create a collapsible divider that is functional and solves the issue of reducing noise 
                            at the site. We wanted to create a divider that was also able to reduce in height if certain sections of 
                            the site or groups of essential workers decided that it would be beneficial to be able to communicate 
                            effectively between each area. In addition, we also wanted to reduce the space that each divider would 
                            take up during transportation to the site. The dividers’ ability to reduce in height allows for less space 
                            needed for transportation. A challenging part of the design process was determining the most effective way 
                            to reduce the size of the dividers. Ultimately, it was decided that thick noise reducing fabric would be 
                            used as the divider material. The fabric would be connected to rods on both sides (using clips on the top 
                            plate) and would be able to fold down to reduce the height of the divider. The fabric would also be able 
                            to be removed from the clips if the user wanted to clean the dividers.

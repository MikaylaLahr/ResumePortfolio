                        <h2 class="subheading">Objective</h2>
                        <p>For this project I worked with other team members to create a product to easily organize loose charging 
                            cables. Current single charging cables need to be coiled by hand before being stored for transportation. 
                            After storage, the cables unravel causing the contents of the bag to become disorganized. Loose cables 
                            in a workstation also cause disorganization.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Functions of Product</h2>
                        <p>Cordial aims to reduce the amount of time needed to collect and store charging devices, as well as provide 
                            an easy way to help organize a work station. The Cordial device stores two charging wires. One wire is a 
                            lightning cable and is compatible with an iPhone. The second wire is a USB-C cable and is compatible with 
                            a MacBook laptop. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Stakeholders</h2>
                        <p>The target audience for our product included people who often carry around phone and/or laptop chargers. 
                            The team was primarily interested in surveying college students, but the product is also applicable to 
                            office workers who no longer work in a set environment due to Covid (work in a office without set desks, 
                            work at home and in office, work at coffee shops/co-working spaces, etc.), or people working remotely. 
                            This audience is representative of the individuals who will likely use the final product design. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The stakeholders for this project included:
                            <li>Competitors: Bibicord, Macally</li>
                            <li>Team: Current Class Team Members</li>
                            <li>Customers & Users: College Students, Remote Workers, Workers at Co-working Spaces, Any worker that 
                                moves around working spaces
                            </li>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Conjoint Analysis</h2>
                        <p>The team members developed a conjoint analysis to collect and analyze data from a sample of our target 
                            population. The survey was aimed towards college students, faculty, practicing manufacturing design and 
                            product engineers, and hybrid workers who move their work station frequently and need to transport their 
                            phone or laptop charger easily. The survey was distributed primarily by sending direct invitations to 
                            students on project teams, students outside of Cornell, and by putting up QR codes with a link to the 
                            survey in designated locations, such as shared study spaces or Coffee Shops. Additionally, the team posted 
                            the survey on online messaging boards including Facebook and Reddit to reach a greater audience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The conjoint analysis survey for Spring 2022 consisted of user questions on various features of the charging 
                            device. These questions included:
                            <li>Retraction Mechanism: Manual or Automatic</li>
                            <li>Shape: Cylindrical (fits in a water bottle holder) or Flat and Rectangular (fits in the main compartment 
                                of a backpack)
                            </li>
                            <li>Price Compared to Existing Charging Setup: Same Price, 1.5 Times the Price, Double the Price</li>
                            <li>Style Components: Modular (can add and remove parts) or Singular (non-changeable, two charging cables)</li>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the conjoint analysis responses (31), price was the most important, followed by the retraction mechanism. 
                            The sample population strongly preferred a charging device that was the same price as an existing charging 
                            setup. An automatic retracting mechanism was more favorable compared to a manual retracting mechanism. From 
                            the responses, there was less of a distinction between shape and style components. The sample population 
                            slightly preferred a flat and rectangular design compared to cylindrical design. A modular design was 
                            preferred compared to a singular design.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">House of Quality</h2>
                        <p>A House of Quality matrix was filled out that depicts the relations between the Demanded Quality and the 
                            Quality Characteristics. The Demanded Quality lists the customer requirements for the product. These 
                            characteristics are important in developing a product that solves a problem or need of the user. The 
                            Quality Characteristics are the functional requirements of how the product will be manufactured and used. 
                            The analysis of these characteristics as well as a comparison between Cordial and competitor companies are 
                            important in determining the potential of success for the product. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Prototype Finite Element Analysis</h2>
                        <p>The Cordial Prototype was built using a 3D printer. To analyze the structural integrity of our design, we 
                            used Autodesk Inventor to do finite element analysis (FEA) to examine how the structural design withstands 
                            static loads from multiple angles. The forces against the connectors of the casing as well as the forces 
                            on the door of the casing were analyzed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Autodesk Inventor was used to conduct a finite element analysis (FES) to analyze the structural integrity 
                            of the design. Static loads at different angles were used to examine how the design would withstand the 
                            loads. Performing an FES analysis was especially important between the top and bottom of the Cordial box 
                            where there are four snap-on connections. The resulting FES plot shows the maximum von Mises stress were 
                            located at the four snap-on connections. However, the material used was thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), 
                            which has high strength durability and flexibility properties.  An additional FEA focused on was the door 
                            on the Cordial that stops the ratchet, the mechanical device which allows rotary motion. The FEA showed 
                            the greatest force acting on the stopping bar and plate. The door was able to withstand the force because 
                            it was composed of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene  (ABS) which has properties of rigidity and hardness. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Outcome</h2>
                        <p>The design of the Cordial charger includes a phone and laptop charger. This is useful because the user does 
                            not have to carry multiple wires with them during transportation. In addition, the Cordial charger 
                            automatically retracts whereas the other chargers currently on the market need to be manually retracted. 
                            In addition, the Cordial charger includes a 3 foot phone charging cable as well as a nearly 6 foot power 
                            adapter extension cable. Additionally the charger can be extended from one direction and automatically 
                            retracted. While the testing of the Cordial prototype was successful, there were a few problems with the 
                            final prototype such as the retracting mechanism which could be fixed by putting another gear in the 
                            subassembly allowing the charging cable to fit between two bearings. Another design issue was the cord 
                            movement being inhibited by the joint door/pawl since it did not work as intended. Lastly another design 
                            issue involved the uneasy movement of the charging wire off the subassembly. Overall the finite analysis 
                            testing was successful, however, it is necessary to conduct further research in order to rectify the design 
                            challenges.
